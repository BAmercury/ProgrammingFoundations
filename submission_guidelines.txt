A zipped folder titled ABC123_hwX.zip that contains the following:
A README.txt titled README.txt

The java files named ABC123_hwXpX.java
For example, for assignment 5, if I were to submit the assignment I would submit the following:
src322_hw5.zip
- README.txt
- src322_hw5p1.java
- src322_hw5p2.java
We will not be deducting points this week for incorrect file formats. This format makes it much easier for the TAs to grade. If you have any questions, please let me know.
Thank you,
Charlie, Amira, and Samyam
